## Step 1. Load libraries

```{r}
# before loading, you need to install each package with install.packages("NAME_OF_PACKAGE")
library(tidyverse) # for MacOS: library(dplyr)
library(haven)
library(skimr)

library(tidyfinance)
```

## Step 2. Import and merge data

We import firm returns and then merge with the firm size.

```{r}
Ret = read_dta(file = "data/Ret.dta")
Size = read_dta(file = "data/Size.dta")
```

**Questions:**

> What are the matching columns of these two data?
>
> Please merge these two data and save as a new R object namely `Data`.

## Step 3. Fama-Macbeth regression

```{r}

```
